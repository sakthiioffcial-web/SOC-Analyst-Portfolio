# Day 7 Portfolio — Malware Simulation & Suspicious Process Detection

## Objective

Simulate a malicious background script and perform endpoint investigation to detect, analyze, and terminate suspicious activity.

---

## Environment

* Kali Linux (VMware)
* Linux Terminal

---

## Step 1 — Malicious Script Creation

### Commands Used

nano suspicious.sh
chmod +x suspicious.sh

### Purpose

Create a simulated malicious script to mimic persistent background activity.

### Observation

Successfully created an executable script that continuously generated activity.
---

## Step 2 — Malware Simulation

### Command Used

./suspicious.sh &

### Purpose

Run the script as a background process to simulate hidden malware.

### Observation

Script executed continuously in the background.

## Step 3 — Process Hunting

### Commands Used

jobs -l
ps aux | grep suspicious

### Purpose

Identify the running malicious process and extract its PID.

### Observation

Detected suspicious background process and recorded its PID.

---

## Step 4 — Process Monitoring

### Command Used

top -p <PID>

### Purpose

Monitor resource usage of the suspicious process.

### Observation

Observed active execution of the simulated malware.

## Step 5 — Persistence Investigation

### Commands Used

crontab -l
ls /etc/cron*

### Purpose

Check common persistence locations used by malware.

### Observation

Reviewed scheduled task locations for unauthorized persistence.

## Step 6 — Threat Removal

### Commands Used

kill <PID>
ps aux | grep suspicious

### Purpose

Terminate the malicious process and confirm removal.

### Observation

Successfully stopped the suspicious process.

## Skills Developed

* Malware simulation
* Process hunting and PID tracking
* Endpoint monitoring
* Persistence detection basics
* Threat termination workflow
